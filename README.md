# Topic Modeling Analysis of Minority Representation in American Media

## About
Topic modeling analysis of Asian American, Hispanic, and African American populations through news articles from the beginning of 2022. The analysis explores both overall trends (over the last 2.5 years) in addition to topic breakdowns over each year to more effectively explore changes in topic frequency and relevance over time. Furthermore, detailed interactive intertopic distance maps illustrate these topics' relationships in a projected 2D space, and further visualizations depict media trends and biases of prominent US news agencies. Download models from the `models` folder.

## Overview of File Structure and Instructions to Run the Programs
Independent functionality to create a dataset of articles using the MediaCloud API is also included; to do this, run the `create_dataset.py` file.

View example pie-chart topic distributions attached in the 'visualizations' folder and use `ProjectModeling_and_Results.ipynb` to run the analysis with the Asian American, Hispanic, and African American article datasets.

To run the analysis with a different dataset, run the `Independent_Dataset_Exploration.ipynb` file to run a similar analysis as the original, with custom topics and parameter tuning.
