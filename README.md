# Minority-USMedia-Representation
Topic modeling analysis of Asian American, Hispanic, and African American populations through news articles from the beginning of 2022. The analysis explores both overall trends (over the last 2.5 years) in addition to topic breakdowns over each year to more effectively explore changes in topic frequency and relevance over time. Download models from the 'models' folder.

Independent functionality to create a dataset of articles using the MediaCloud API is also included; to do this, run the `create_dataset.py` file.

View example pie-chart topic distributions attached in the 'visualizations' folder and use `ProjectModeling_and_Results.ipynb` to run the analysis with the Asian American, Hispanic, and African American article datasets.

To run the analysis with a different dataset, run the `Independent_Dataset_Exploration.ipynb` file to run a similar analysis as the original, with custom topics and parameter tuning.
